# Todos

**Deprecated!** Use [todomvc chaplin-brunch](https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/labs/dependency-examples/chaplin-brunch) instead.

This is a rewrite of Todos (Backbone's example application). We rewrote it to provide a simple and complete brunch example. Special thanks to [Jérôme Gravel-Niquet](http://jgn.me/) for his groundwork.

## Development

Use `brunch build` or `brunch watch` to compile changes in src folder.
Usually we don't track the js/css files in our repositories, but decided to keep them here because we hope it would be easier to start using it.
